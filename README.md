# Region Adjacency Graph (RAG)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Region Adjacency Graph (RAG), a data structure used in image processing and computer vision. RAG represents an image as a graph, where each node corresponds to a region in the image, and edges connect adjacent regions. This representation is useful for various tasks such as image segmentation and analysis.

## Features

- **Region Adjacency Graph Construction:** Efficient algorithms for constructing the Region Adjacency Graph from an input image.
  
- **Graph-based Image Segmentation:** Utilize the constructed RAG for image segmentation tasks.

- **Example Usage:** Explore examples and usage scenarios in the `examples` directory.
